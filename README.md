# Harbiz - Coding assessment

**Data**:

Trainers have a reputation rating between 0 and 5 (with 5 being the most favorable).
Clients value the importance of having a trainer with a good reputation from 0 to 10 (with 10 being that they place a lot of importance on their trainer being highly rated, and 0 being that they don't care about their trainer's rating at all).
Trainers also have a limit on the number of available places for clients.

**Objective**:

The objective is to assign all clients to a trainer in such a way that the set of clients has the highest satisfaction value. This satisfaction can be measured as you see fit, feel free to establish the criteria you consider.

A resolution to this issue using Node.js and preferably TypeScript is expected.
